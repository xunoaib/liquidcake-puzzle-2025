		<h1>Part 2</h1>
<p>The elf did try their best, and you're sure that <em>all full numbers they have written that match the corresponding clue are correct</em>.</p>

<p>After keeping only the digits of the puzzle from clues the elf wrote correctly, you have:</p>

<pre>
2   
4   
1397

</pre>

<p>From this, you fill in the remaining digits:</p>

<pre>
2799
4326
1397
5275
</pre>

<p>After finishing, ignoring the clues, and the wrapping, there will be a number of sequences of odd digits. On the smaller puzzle, these are 799, 3, 1397, 5 and 75. The sum of these is 2279.</p>

<p>What is the sum of the numbers made only of odd digits in the larger puzzle?</p>
